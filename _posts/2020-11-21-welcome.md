I would personal like to welcome you to this blog post!  Brief intro.  My name is Justin Leach, nice to meet you.  I have been developing for over 10 years.  I have worked on a variety of things, including:

* CSS
* HTML
* JavaScript

In this blog, my intent is to go over things I have either learned or want to learn.  

Enjoy!
